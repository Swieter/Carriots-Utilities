# Carriots-Utilities
This repo contains utiltiies for accessing Carriots IoT service.
The code is written in Python.

You can run this code locally or via a service like [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/?affiliate_id=00011020).  I prefer to use a cloud based service like PythonAnywhere because it gives quicker access to other cloud service APIs, instead of being limited by the connection between my local machine and the cloud.  Signing up for PythonAnywhere helps to support work like this.
